# Intro

This repository is about using PowerShell as a quick way to search your current Active Directory about your Exchange servers without having to install the Exchange admin tools or even the Active Directory module.

By extension, you can search for users, computers, groups, and all sort of objects that Active Directory stores.

# Principle

We're using what we call "type accelerators", which are in PowerShell quick way to refer to .NET libraries.
